        # The best example is if a current user has permissions A, and
        # target user has permission A and B. If I try to remove permission B
        # from the target user, the POST-request matches the current users
        # permissions (only A) in the `validate_max_permissions` call. However,
        # when you check the existing permissions with
        # `validate_max_user_permissions`, it detects that the target user
        # actually has permission B as well so you cannot change this user
        # (since he has more permissions).
